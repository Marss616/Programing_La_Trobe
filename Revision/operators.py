# Arithmetic Operators : Exponentiation   
x = 10
y = 5

print('The Exponentiation of (10 ** 5) or 10*10*10*10*10 is: ', x ** y)
# above is same as: print(10*10*10*10*10)


# Arithmetic Operators : Modulus
x1 = int(15)
y1 = int(10)
z = x1 % y1

print('The module of 15 % 10: ', z)
# above is same as asking how many 10s can fit into 15, the answer is 1 with 5 left over.

x2 = int(15)
y2 = int(3)
z = x2 // y2

print('The floor divison of 15 // 10: ', z)
